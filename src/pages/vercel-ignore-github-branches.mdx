I'm writing this blog post as a follow-up to my other post about deploying Frontity to Vercel with GitHub. After I had set up the GitHub deploy, I installed Dependabot in all my projects, so it updates packages automatically.

I had actually never heard of Dependabot, as I am still quite new to GitHub. But I managed to install it quite easily, and it works like a charm. The only thing I did not like about it, is that for each Dependabot PR, a branch was made. And with Vercel, every branch gets a preview build. That becomes a lot of builds.

So I wanted to see if it was a way I could stop this, and after reading on the Vercel GitHub, and documentation, I found a solution. Vercel has a field called "Ignore build step" in the git settings, which you should read more about. But what I did was make a Bash script that runs before every build is started. The script looks like this:

```
#!/bin/bash

if [[ $VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF =~ "dependabot" ]] ; then
  echo ">> Skipping deploy!"
  exit 0;
else
  echo ">> Proceeding with deploy."
  exit 1;
fi
```

My goal was to stop preview builds from Dependabot branches, so I made a regex that checks if the variable $VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF contains the word dependabot. The variable is the name of the branch, and every branch that Dependabot makes contains the word Dependabot. I wrote the script in a file called vercel.sh, which I put in the root of my project.

As you can see, before I added the script, every PR triggered a preview build:

<Picture
	src={before}
	widths={[300, 400, 480, 570]}
	sizes="(min-width: 570px) 570px, 100vw"
	alt="GitHub pull request without dependabot"
/>

But now, after the script, it looks like this:

<Picture
	src={after}
	widths={[300, 400, 480, 570]}
	sizes="(min-width: 570px) 570px, 100vw"
	alt="GitHub pull request with dependabot"
/>

As you can see, the preview build is canceled. Here is a quick guide on how to do it:

## Make a Bash file

You need to create a bash file (.sh) with these commands, and place it in the project, make sure it is uploaded to the GitHub repo.

```
#!/bin/bash

if [[ $VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF =~ "dependabot" ]] ; then
  echo ">> Skipping deploy!"
  exit 0;
else
  echo ">> Proceeding with deploy."
  exit 1;
fi
```

You don't have to use this to only stop dependabot, you can make a new regex if you want it to stop something else.

# Define the script in Vercel settings

In the settings of your project in Vercel, you need to run the script. You do this at the bottom of the Git tab.

<Picture
	src={buildstep}
	widths={[300, 400, 480, 570]}
	sizes="(min-width: 570px) 570px, 100vw"
	alt="Vercel project settings -> git -> ignored build step"
/>

My script is called vercel.sh, and it is placed at the root of the project. So I just write "bash vercel.sh". If you want to, you can place the script in the folder in the project, but then you need to enter "bash relative-path/vercel.sh".

So now, every time a branch is made that matches your regex, this script will stop it from making a preview build.
