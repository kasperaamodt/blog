title: How I made this website

I recently rebuilt my website, ground up. I wanted to do it because the previous version was in WP, and since I built that, I have learned a lot of new stuff. Here I'm writing about the different technologies I used to make this new website.

## Next JS

I rebuilt the site in the first place because I recently learned about Next JS and wanted to make a website with it. My experience with it has been excellent, and making this website was a great experience. As they state on the website, Next JS is a production-ready framework, which is absolutely true. It has hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.

## WordPress

My site is a blog, and as I did not want to merge all my posts to a new platform, I kept WP as a backend. Over the years, I have grown to like WP, and the new Gutenberg editor is a great way to write blog posts. So I kept it, and I do not regret it. I like the combination of WP and Next JS because a lot of customers are used to writing and editing content in WP, which they can continue to do. At the same time, they can have a fast frontend with Next JS.

## Goober

For styling, I like to use css-in-js, and my go-to for a long time was Emotion. I never really chose it, it was included by default in a WP React framework called Frontity. But for this project, I decided to look around a little more. I follow one of the earlier employees of Frontity on Twitter, and it turns out that he made a lightweight css-in-js library called Goober.

Goober is a less than 1KB css-in-js solution that works like styled-components or Emotion, but it is much smaller. It's easy to set up, easy to use, and supports autoprefixing, TypeScript, and more.

## html-react-parser

This npm package is used to replace standard images in blog posts with the image component from next. This reduces the images sizes significantly and makes the site more performant.

## Preact

I use Preact for the production build of the website, but not in development. The reason is to reduce the js bundle size, and since I don't use any advanced react logic, it's straightforward to switch it out.

## Plausible

For analytics, I have used Plausible Analytics. Plausible is a lightweight and open-source website analytics tool. It uses no cookies and fully complies with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR. It's also made and hosted in the EU. Plausible is not only privacy-friendly, but it is also 45 (!!!) times smaller than GA. As someone who spends a lot of time optimizing, that was such a great feeling to get rid of that slow loading speed while waiting for GA to load.

## Vercel

And finally, hosting. For hosting, I'm using Vercel, as I do with all my projects. I've never used a platform with the same developer experience when it comes to hosting. Deploying, previewing, and shipping have never been easier, and I have never looked back after choosing Vercel as my platform of choice.
