Yesterday I published my first YouTube video, and it felt amazing. I've wanted to do it for a long time, but I've always found reasons not to. But this week, I decided that enough is enough, and I recorded my first video. And now, I can't wait to record my next one.

The video is about how you can make a headless WordPress website with Next.js and GraphQL. I learned how to do it by making this website. This website has a Next.js frontend and a WordPress with GraphQL backend.

## Moving forward

My goal is to try to post 2-4 videos a month, sometimes, maybe more. I work on a lot of different stuff during the week, and I learn many different things. And I want to share those things that I learn and find cool. I'm planning on doing longer code sessions but also small and concise guides.

I was nervous before I pressed publish on the video. Putting yourself out there on the big world web may seem scary. But since posting it, the only thing I have wanted to do is record a new video, which I find promising going forward. So that's what I'm going to do, record more videos. You can find them on my new YouTube channel. And please, don't forget to like and subscribe. ðŸ˜‰
