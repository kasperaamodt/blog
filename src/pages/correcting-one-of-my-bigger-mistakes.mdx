I started my company “Accelr” in 2022, and I wanted it to have cool and modern name. After much thought I ended up with the name “Accelr”, which I still like. The problem is that my company is mainly focused on the Norwegian SMB market. And it turns out that this modern name is very hard for Norwegians to grasp. So I’m always saying the name 2-3 times, and I also often have to spell it for people to understand.

This changes today. I’m changing the name to “Devhuset”, which translates to “Devhouse”. I’m looking forward to using the new name, as I believe it will be much easier to mention the name of the company going forward.
